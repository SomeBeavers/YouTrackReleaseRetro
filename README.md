# AI-Powered ReSharper Release Analyzer

## Description
This project aims to simplify the analysis of ReSharper releases by leveraging AI to process and interpret data from YouTrack. The Python-based tool will automatically gather information about issues from YouTrack, such as the number of tickets sorted by priority for each release in the current year. The AI component will then analyze this data to provide insights, trends, and potential areas for improvement.

## Features
- Analyze YouTrack issue data to identify release trends and quality metrics.
- Leverage OpenAIâ€™s capabilities to generate meaningful insights from historical data.
- Provide actionable insights for continuous improvement in software releases.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- A YouTrack permanent token [Get it here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/youtrack/server/manage-permanent-token.html)
- An OpenAI API key [Get it here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

## Setup

1. Set up environment variables for YouTrack and OpenAI tokens:
   - **For Windows**:
     ```bash
     set YOUTRACK_TOKEN=your_youtrack_token
     set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```
   - **For macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     export YOUTRACK_TOKEN=your_youtrack_token
     export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
     ```
